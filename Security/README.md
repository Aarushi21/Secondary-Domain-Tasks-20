# Kali Linux Basics

## Instructions
- Either Dual Boot (at your own risk) or setup Kali Linux on VM Virtual Box using [this link](http://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-kali-linux-on-virtualbox).
- Also install Ubuntu in virtual box, which would act as defender. Link for step by step guide is [this](https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/). 
- Then setup firewall rules to block incoming requests to port 440 and network 182.160.0.0. 
- Accept requests on server 192.168.43.254 for ssh only.
